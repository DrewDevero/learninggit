Maggie's test!

I just watched your youtube videos on creating and navigating repositories on GIT and merging local Git repositories with the cloud via Git Hub. Very informative videos on the patch of learning "stick shift" as you put it. 
I'm learning/updating my knowledge base and I plan on placing some work on Git Hub soon to continue learning through doing via this collaborative space so your work was a great introduction after Git Hub's internal one. 
Thank you for the edutainment, Mr. Hanselman. 
No need to merge this XD.

Thanks for the compliment!

Of course! - Drew

Since viewing your videos on git and github, I've generated, and have been maintaining repositories. I've even made a site live using git pages, which really helped set me up for my first project before I began the coding bootcamp/cohort I'm currently in. Thanks again for the excellent educational videos Mr. Hanselman; they're so very relevant/helpful. - Drew
